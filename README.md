My new project — Under Development

Project Overview
This project is a simple ERP system focused on supply chain management, developed using C#, ASP.NET MVC, and Web API. The system is currently under development and is designed to handle various aspects of the supply chain process — from inventory and orders to supplier and product management.

The architecture includes a detailed UML class diagram that outlines the main entities and their relationships.
Using the MVC interface, administrators can fully manage the system through a web dashboard, while the Web API allows integration and interaction with external front-end applications or third-party systems.
